# RandomNumber

I'm trying to acheive 3 tasks in this project

1. Listen to a server which generates a random number and store those numbers along with timestamp in CoreData storage if the number is in the range of 1-9.
2. If two consecutive numbers are identical then user will receive a local push notification in his phone.
3. Showing a live spline chart which updates periodically after 4 seconds with the new number.
